### Week 4 Plans
This week we went over many different things:
- So this week was focused on mostly building our blog pages. We have to modify all of the old links put there in the schedule, and add in new ones. To start, I added in two tangibles for Week 2, snake game, and the calculator. In addition, I found a flying ship game online, and added it into my blog as well. I also changed the Week 0,1,2 plans, and wrote down a summary of what I did in those weeks (like what I am doing right now). I got rid of the CSA and CSSE links and changed CSP to Comp Sci.
