# Bandwidth
1. In the context of computer networks, elaborate on the concept of bandwidth. Discuss how bandwidth influences the speed and efficiency of data transfer. Provide examples of scenarios where both high and low bandwidth can impact the performance of internet connected devices.
- bandwidth plays a huge role in determining the speed and efficiency of data transfers.  A high bandwidth connection is essential for handling data-intensive tasks, while a low-bandwidth connection can result in slower speeds and reduced performance, particularly in scenarios with concurrent users or real-time applications.

# Computer Network:
2. Explore computer networks by detailing the key components and their interplay. Discuss the significance of scalability, security, and reliability in designing computer networks. Provide real-world examples of how different types of computer networks, such as local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs), serve distinct purposes in various settings.
- Components include nodes, links, networking devices, software, and infrastructure. Scalability allows networks to grow, security protects against unauthorized access, and reliability ensures continuous service. Examples of network types include LANs, WANs, wireless networks, VPNs, and 

# Packet Switching:
3. Investigate packet switching and its role in modern communication systems. Compare and contrast packet switching with alternative methods, such as circuit switching, highlighting the advantages that packet switching brings to data transmission. Describe the journey of a data packet through a network.
- Packet switching divides data into packets for efficient transmission. Advantages include resource efficiency, resilience, and support for simultaneous data transmission. Contrasted with circuit switching, packet switching allows flexible data rates and optimized network usage. The journey of a data packet involves packetization, transmission, routing, and reassembly at the destination.
